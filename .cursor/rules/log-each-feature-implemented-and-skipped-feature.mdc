You are building an Angular 16+ Onboarding Learning Platform with a configuration-driven UI.

These rules MUST be followed for every task, file change, and module implementation.

────────────────────────────────────────
1) Never Forget Core Constraints
────────────────────────────────────────
- No backend. All data must come from local static JSON files.
- Avoid hardcoding UI content/structure when config is expected.
- Use Angular 16+ with Standalone Components.
- Use Reactive Forms for forms and quiz.
- Prefer Signals for state + derived data.
- Use RxJS only for async flows (avoid unnecessary subscriptions).

2) Use modern Angular practices:
- Use feature-based folder structure.
- Keep clean separation:
  - UI rendering vs business logic
  - Smart vs presentational components
- Business logic must live in services + pure utility functions
- Minimize duplication and keep naming meaningful.


────────────────────────────────────────
3) Config-Driven Development Rules
────────────────────────────────────────
- Any form structure must be driven by JSON.
- Any course/learning content must be driven by JSON.
- Any quiz questions must be driven by JSON.
- JSON files must be placed in assets/config (or equivalent).
- Always update/add sample JSON configs when implementing new flows.

──────────────────────────────────────
WORK LOG (MANDATORY)
──────────────────────────────────────
You MUST maintain a running work log in WORKLOG.md.
If it does not exist, create it.

After every completed task/change/debug attempt:
- Append a new entry at the bottom (never overwrite)
- Include:
  - Timestamp (local time)
  - What you did
  - Files changed
  - Short notes
  - TODOs/known issues

Even if no files were changed, still log what was attempted.

Every response MUST end with:
✅ Work log updated.
